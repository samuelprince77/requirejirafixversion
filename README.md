# Require JIRA fix version chrome extension
This chrome extension alerts you if you move a JIRA ticket to ready to test column without specifying a fix version. It makes use of [Mutation Summary](https://github.com/rafaelw/mutation-summary) to listen for specific DOM changes that signal a ticket is being moved to the test column. If a fix version is missing, the resolve button click will trigger a confirmation alert and depending on the result of the confirmation, you can return to the ticket and fix the issue or proceed, ignoring the warning.
